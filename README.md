# The Blog App -- task

> Created a blog app in React.js. I have not used any UI framework. My pure focus was on implementing functionalities like (Creating Blog, Editing Blog Deleting Blog, View Blog, Main page which shows only title of blog, Like Blog features). 

> I had used localstorage for storing data and also used context API for fast rendering on the component.

> UI is not up to the marks, since time was very short. I have worked a lot on UI and I can create decent looking UI.
